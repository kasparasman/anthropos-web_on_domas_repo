  "communicator": "========================================\nANTHROPOS CITY – COMMUNICATOR ARCHETYPE\nFuturist Portrait • 1 : 1 Square • Shoulders-Up\n========================================\n\nINPUTS\n• USER_SELFIE (image provided)        # shoulders-up, neutral light\n• STYLE_REFERENCE (image provided)     # The archetype style card\n• LIMITLESS_CREST (image provided)       # The shaka PNG\n\nOUTPUT\n• 3000 × 3000 px PNG\n• Crop: top of head ↘ mid-upper-chest (no arms)\n• Metadata JSON: { \"archetype\":\"communicator\",\"version\":\"1.0\",\"palette_locked\":true }\n\nSTYLE LOCKS\n• ART STYLE (MANDATORY) — The final image must be a stylized vector illustration. It should have bold lines, flat colors or simple gradients, and a clean, graphic appearance. Avoid photorealism, complex textures, and subtle shading to ensure the avatar looks like digital art, not a photograph.\n• Art Method: clean vector-cel shading; smooth gradients; **no** photoreal texture\n• Palette: Peach #FFC9A0 primary, Cobalt #004FE0 accent, soft coral and sky blue gradients\n• BACKGROUND MANDATE — render the {district} scene in sharp focus; background must be opaque.\n• Garment: casual blazer with subtle waveform embroidery on collar/shoulders, upper chest only (no arms)\n• FX: Subtle animated voice-wave motif integrated into the background, repeating in a soft, abstract pattern (looping, 1 sec cycle); use cobalt as the primary accent color. Wave amplitude ≈ 2 mm; opacity ≤ 12 %. No tattoo or direct overlay on the face or jawline. Maintain a gentle cobalt glow radiating from the throat area.\n• LIMITLESS CREST (MANDATORY)\n  – Overlay the PNG provided in LIMITLESS_CREST (image provided) onto the left-breast panel, scaling it to ~9 % of full frame height.\n  – Do not distort, mirror, rotate or recolour the crest; keep its original gold fill. Apply a thin outline and inner glow in the archetype's accent colors (see palette), and a 3 px soft shadow for readability.\n  – CRITICAL: The LIMITLESS_CREST (image provided) logo depicts a \"call me\" hand gesture (thumb and pinky extended, three middle fingers folded) exactly as shown in the reference image. This logo must be rendered accurately. Do NOT add any additional hand gestures to the avatar itself. This is a passport-style portrait showing only head and shoulders - the avatar's hands should NOT be visible in the image.\n• Emotion: inviting openness, direct gaze, gentle smile, balanced bright lighting\n• Expression — match the user's facial expression and mood exactly as seen in USER_SELFIE (image provided) (mirror eyebrow position, eye openness, mouth curve, etc.).\n• VECTOR AESTHETIC (MANDATORY)\n  – Crisp, uniform line art (2–4 px stroke); corners slightly rounded for modern SVG look.\n  – Flat colour blocks or max two-step gradients; NO painterly brush textures or noise shaders.\n  – Cel-style shading only (hard or soft-edge bands); highlights as simple geometric shapes.\n  – Neon glows and glitch artifacts allowed **only** as additive overlays ≤ 15 % opacity; must not blur the line work.\n\n• BACKGROUND LOGIC  (MANDATORY — replace {} braces)\n\n  1. **LANDMARK** – include the signature landmark of this archetype's district at mid-ground scale (occupies ±30 % of width).\n\n  2. **DEPTH LAYERS** – draw at least three vector layers:\n        • Foreground silhouettes (low-opacity crowds, railings, foliage, etc.)\n        • Mid-ground with the landmark & neighbouring structures\n        • Background skyline fading toward horizon colour\n\n  3. **LIGHTING** – use a strong key light matching the palette transition (peach → coral); cast long, stylised shadows for drama.\n\n  4. **ATMOSPHERE** – add subtle volumetric glow or city haze (≤ 12 % opacity) so neon accents \"pop\".\n\n  5. **DETAIL QUALITY** – keep edges crisp and geometry readable at 100 % zoom; no painterly strokes or photo textures.\n\n  • Background must be fully **opaque** (no alpha holes, no flat gradient without architecture).\n\nNEGATIVE BACKGROUND PROMPT  \n\"empty gradient, blank backdrop, generic shapes, photo texture, photographic city\"\n\nNEGATIVE PROMPT\n\"photorealistic, photo, photography, realism, hyperrealism, realistic lighting, realistic shadows, detailed skin texture, pores, wrinkles, skin blemishes, individual hair strands, human-like, 8k, ultra-realistic, detailed face, real life, dslr, film grain\"\n\"halo, nimbus, angel ring, circular glow behind head, transparent background, checkerboard, alpha background, blank gradient background, missing crest\"\n\"mirrored shaka, left-pointing shaka, upside-down shaka, thumbs-down, rock sign, peace sign, finger bars left\"\n\"hang loose sign, shaka sign, thumb down position, incorrect hand gesture, wrong finger position\"\n\"visible hands, arms showing, call me gesture by avatar, hands in frame, avatar making hand signs\"\n\"oil painting, brush strokes, photorealistic texture\"\n\nRULES\n1. Exact facial likeness; reproduce selfie accessories precisely.\n2. Apply every STYLE LOCK (including crest); do not add/remove elements.\n3. Keep 1 : 1 aspect; nothing below upper chest.\n4. Deliver PNG + metadata JSON.\n5. **NATURAL SKIN TONE (MANDATORY): The avatar's facial skin tone MUST precisely match the natural human skin tone from the USER_SELFIE (image provided) input. Do NOT alter, stylize, tint, or shift the skin color to match the background palette or archetype colors. Maintain realistic human skin tones exactly as they appear in the original selfie. Only subtle lighting effects from the scene are permitted, but these must not change the base skin tone.**\n6. **NO TEXT OR TYPOGRAPHY: Do not add any text, words, numbers, letters, symbols, labels, watermarks, or typographic elements to the avatar image.**\n7. **STRICT ASPECT RATIO: The final portrait must strictly maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio (perfect square) at every stage of processing and output. No stretching, padding, cropping, or compositional changes are allowed that would alter the square format.**\n8. **VECTOR AI ART STYLE (MANDATORY): The entire avatar must be rendered in a clean, modern vector AI art style, with no raster, painterly, or photorealistic elements whatsoever. All aspects including face, hair, clothing, background, and effects must be vector-based.**\n9. **HUMAN SKIN COLORS ONLY (MANDATORY): The face and all visible skin must use ONLY natural human skin tones. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: blue skin, green skin, purple skin, gray skin, metallic skin, alien skin colors, fantasy skin colors, or any non-human skin pigmentation. The avatar must look realistically human in skin color.**\n10. Do not copy user's face skin imperfections such as pimples, acne.\n11. Facial features and skin color must not be photorealistic. The face must be rendered in a clean, modern vector AI art style, with zero photorealism. Skin colors must always be natural, realistic human tones, never stylized or exaggerated.
